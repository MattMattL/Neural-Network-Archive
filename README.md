## Neural Networks Archive

'14 DeepNNetBase.java' includes the latest progress: DNNs with variable width and depth.

* This repository is a collection of neural networks I wrote and tested for fun between 2016 and 2019. Some of the earlier versions are for testing the mathematics and extensability, and the later ones are more focused on modulability so as to be imported in other personal projects.

* The very early version used one-layer neural networks with input & output vectors and later improved by using arrays, OpenCL, OpenCV and different mathematical methods and optimisations. The files are in C, C++ or Java (.h or .h pp for header files) for different projects and purpose.
