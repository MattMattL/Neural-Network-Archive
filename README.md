## Neural Networks Archive

Please check out '14 DeepNNetBase.java' for the latest progress (DNN with variable width and depth).

This repository is a collection of neural network structures I wrote and tested out of my pure interests since 2018. Some early versions are created for testing the maths, and the later ones are designed to be imported for other personal projects.

The very early version used one-layer neural networks with input & output vectors and later improved by using arrays, OpenCL, OpenCV and different mathematical methods and optimisations. The files are in C, C++ or Java (.h or .h pp for header files) for different projects and purpose.

Files are roughly sorted by the date created.
