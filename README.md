## Neural Networks Archive

Please check out '14 DeepNNetBase.java' for the latest progress (a deep neural net with variable width and depth).

This repository is a collection of neural network structures I have written and tested out of pure interests since 2018. Some early versions are created for testing the maths, and the later ones are designed to be imported for other personal projects.

The very early version used one-layer neural networks with input & output vectors and later improved by using arrays, OpenCL, OpenCV and different mathematical methods and optimisations. The files are in C, C++ or Java (.h or .h pp for header files) for different projects and purpose.

The files are roughly sorted by the date created.
