<Neural Networks Archive>

Please check out '14 DeepNNetBase.java' for the latest progress (a deep neural net with variable width and depth).


This is a collection of neural network structures I have wrote and tested out of pure interests, since January 2018. The files are created for testing the mathematics, and some are designed to be imported for other personal projects.

The very early version used one-layer neural networks with input & output vector of size 2, and later improved by using arrays, OpenCL, OpenCV and different mathematical methods and optimisation. The files are written in C, C++ or Java (.h or .hpp for header files) for different projects and purpose.

Files are roughly sorted by the date created.
